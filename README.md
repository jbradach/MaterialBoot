Material Boot
=============

WordPress theme using Material Design for Bootstrap based on Automatic's [_s theme](http://underscores.me).

To Do
-----

* ~~Split app.js into two for enqueueing purposes.~~
* ~~Potentially split style.css.~~
* Apply basic Bootstrap formatting.
* Color preferences.

Notes from _s README.md:
------------------------

* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in `functions.php` and adding the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts/` for a sidebar on either side of your content.
